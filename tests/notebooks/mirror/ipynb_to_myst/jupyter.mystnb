# Jupyter notebook

This notebook is a simple jupyter notebook. It only has markdown and code cells. And it does not contain consecutive markdown cells. We start with an addition:

```{nb-code}
a = 1
b = 2
a + b
```
Now we return a few tuples

```{nb-code}
a, b
```

```{nb-code}
a, b, a+b
```
And this is already the end of the notebook
